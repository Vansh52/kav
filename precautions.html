<h1><large>PRECAUTIONS TAKEN DURING COVID-19</large></h1>
<p>Preventative measures are your first line of defense. The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to practice good hygiene and to make these CDC recommendations part of your routine:
<p>•Wash your hand,often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
<p>•If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
<p>•Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
<p>•Avoid close contact with people who are sick
<p>•Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, rather than into your hands.
<p>•Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surface
